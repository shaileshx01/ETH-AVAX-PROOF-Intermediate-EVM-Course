# ETH-AVAX-PROOF-Intermediate-EVM-Course

Written in Solidity, a programming language used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, this program is a straightforward contract. The contract consists of a single function that determines the value of the variable by verifying certain constraints provided in the program to determine the object's weight by calculating its mass. The formula for i.e., weight = mass * gravity, is well known. The concepts of functions and error handling are used in this application.

In order to keep your smart contract secure and accurate, you must utilize these error handling lines sparingly. Recall that although assert() should only be used to check for internal issues and should not fail under normal circumstances, require() and revert() eat up all gas when they fail.
